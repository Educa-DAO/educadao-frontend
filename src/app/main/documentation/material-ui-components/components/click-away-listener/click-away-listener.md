# Click-away listener

<p class="description">Detect if a click event happened outside of an element. It listens for clicks that occur somewhere in the document.</p>

- ‚öõÔ∏è Supports portals

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Example

For instance, if you need to hide a menu dropdown when people click anywhere else on your page:

{{"demo": "ClickAway.js"}}

Notice that the component only accepts one child element.
You can find a more advanced demo on the [Menu documentation section](/material-ui/react-menu/#menulist-composition).

## Portal

The following demo uses [`Portal`](/material-ui/react-portal/) to render the dropdown into a new "subtree" outside of current DOM hierarchy.

{{"demo": "PortalClickAway.js"}}

## Leading edge

By default, the component responds to the trailing events (click + touch end).
However, you can configure it to respond to the leading events (mouse down + touch start).

{{"demo": "LeadingClickAway.js"}}

:::warning
‚ö†Ô∏è In this mode, only interactions on the scrollbar of the document is ignored.
:::

## Accessibility

By default `<ClickAwayListener />` will add an `onClick` handler to its children.
This can result in e.g. screen readers announcing the children as clickable.
However, the purpose of the `onClick` handler is not to make `children` interactive.

In order to prevent screen readers from marking non-interactive children as "clickable" add `role="presentation"` to the immediate children:

```tsx
<ClickAwayListener>
  <div role="presentation">
    <h1>non-interactive heading</h1>
  </div>
</ClickAwayListener>
```

This is also required to fix a quirk in NVDA when using Firefox that prevents announcement of alert messages (see [mui/material-ui#29080](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/29080)).

## Unstyled

As the component does not have any styles, it also comes with the Base package.

```js
import ClickAwayListener from '@mui/base/ClickAwayListener';
```
